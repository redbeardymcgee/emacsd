* Lisp
** Configure ~lispy~
I like to be a full-commit kind of person. If I'm going to get good lisp editing
support, I don't want it only halfway. ~lispy~ offers a very interesting
approach, but it very much expects the user to be in a bog-standard emacs
editing state or mode, *not* the vim-inspired modes provided by ~evil-mode~.

~lispyville~ tries to solve this problem by providing keybinds across various modes.
Some presets are modeless and are offered as a sort of all-or-nothing remapping approach.
Other presets have default modes in which they are active, but can be configured to
activate in additional modes by wrapping it in a list followed by the corresponding ~evil-mode~
symbols.

See [[https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville#key-themes][Key Themes]] for descriptions.
